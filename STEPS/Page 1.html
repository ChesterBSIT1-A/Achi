<p>Make a Plan</p>
<p>My main goal in life is to own a successful company. This is my main goal in life because I want to be able to be the boss, not have one. I want to be able to do what I want not what someone else wants. My short term goals this year were to pass every quarter with B+ and up. I didnâ€™t achieve these goals sadly; it was mainly being lazy.</p>
